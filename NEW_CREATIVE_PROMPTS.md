# New Creative Prompts Collection
## Creativity, Cities & Glass Dioramas

Based on the analyzed prompt engineering patterns, here are new creative prompts following the established successful formulas:

---

## üé® **CREATIVITY & ARTISTIC WORKSPACES**

### **Creative Mind Explosion**
```
Generate a photorealistic double exposure image of a human head silhouette on a white background. Inside the silhouette, showcase a vibrant explosion of creative elements: floating paintbrushes dripping rainbow colors, vintage cameras, musical notes, scattered sketches, origami birds in flight, and swirling galaxies of inspiration. The elements should appear to be bursting out from the top of the head like creative thoughts materializing. Use dynamic lighting with soft glows around each creative element. Generate in a 3:2 aspect ratio.
```

### **Artist's Desk Knolling**
```
A top-down knolling image of a creative artist's workspace. Include various artistic tools arranged at 90-degree angles: watercolor palettes with mixed colors, various paintbrushes, charcoal pencils, vintage fountain pen, crumpled paper balls, color swatches, a vintage magnifying glass, tubes of paint with squeezed colors, sketching papers with half-finished drawings, and coffee stains. Everything should be precisely organized on a weathered wooden table surface. Generate in a 1:1 aspect ratio.
```

### **POV Creative Breakthrough**
```
A photorealistic POV image of a person's hands holding a glowing lightbulb that's cracking open like an egg. Inside the bulb, miniature scenes of creativity are visible: tiny painters on easels, musicians playing instruments, and writers at typewriters. The person is wearing paint-stained artist gloves, and scattered around the foreground are art supplies, crumpled papers, and coffee cups. Warm golden light emanates from the bulb, illuminating the cluttered creative workspace. Keep it in a 3:2 aspect ratio.

## üèôÔ∏è **CITY & URBAN LANDSCAPES**

### **Neon Cyberpunk Street POV**
```
A photorealistic POV image of a person walking through a narrow cyberpunk alley at night. They are wearing a weathered leather jacket with neon reflections, and their hands are visible in the foreground holding a holographic device. The alley is lined with towering skyscrapers covered in bright neon signs with Japanese characters, steam rising from manholes, and flying cars visible in the distance. Rain drops are hitting the camera lens, creating lens flares from the neon lights. Generate in a 2:3 aspect ratio.
```

### **Vintage City Travel Poster**
```
Generate a vintage travel poster of a 1950s American downtown cityscape. The image should feature classic art deco buildings, vintage cars on busy streets, and people in period clothing. Include "DOWNTOWN AMERICA" at the top and "Where Dreams Come True" at the bottom. The poster should have weathered edges and a slightly faded color palette typical of mid-century travel advertisements. Use warm sunset lighting casting long shadows between the buildings. The image is in a 2:3 format.
```

### **Urban Decay Flash Photography**
```
Generate a grungy-style photo taken with a harsh camera flash that is unedited. The scene shows an abandoned subway station platform with cracked tiles, graffiti-covered walls, and overgrown vegetation pushing through concrete. A lone figure in a hooded jacket is sitting on a bench reading a glowing tablet, creating a stark contrast between old and new. Puddles reflect the camera flash, and pigeons are scattered around eating crumbs. The image has a raw, documentary feel. Generate in a 3:2 aspect ratio.
```

## üèôÔ∏èüîÆ **CITIES INSIDE GLASS**

### **Metropolitan Snow Globe**
```
Generate a hyper-realistic image of an elaborate snow globe containing a complete miniature cityscape. The city features towering skyscrapers with working LED lights, tiny moving vehicles on multi-level highways, and microscopic people walking on sidewalks. Instead of snow, the globe contains floating golden sparks and tiny paper airplanes. The globe sits on an ornate brass base with intricate engravings. The glass surface shows realistic reflections and subtle fingerprint smudges. Dramatic lighting creates depth and makes the city lights glow warmly through the glass. Generate in a 1:1 aspect ratio.
```

### **City in a Wine Glass**
```
A photorealistic macro photograph of a complete futuristic city built inside an elegant wine glass. The city features crystal spires, floating platforms connected by light bridges, and tiny holographic advertisements. The wine glass is sitting on a marble surface in an upscale restaurant, with blurred background diners visible. Condensation droplets on the outside of the glass create magnifying effects that distort parts of the city. Ambient restaurant lighting creates warm reflections on the glass surface and illuminates the miniature metropolis within. Use a 2:3 aspect ratio.
```

### **Terrarium Megacity**
```
Generate a photorealistic image of a massive city ecosystem contained within a large geometric glass terrarium. The city spans multiple levels: underground subway systems, street level with parks and buildings, and elevated sky platforms with flying vehicles. Tiny LED lights illuminate streets and buildings, while miniature trees and green spaces are integrated throughout. The terrarium sits on a thick wooden table with visible wood grain texture. Soft natural lighting filters through the glass panels, creating realistic shadows and reflections. Gentle mist effects add atmosphere to the contained cityscape. Generate in a 3:2 aspect ratio.
```

### **Laboratory City Specimen**
```
A photorealistic image of a pristine laboratory setting where a complete modern city is contained within a large scientific bell jar. The city features realistic skyscrapers, highways with tiny moving cars, and working street lights. Scientific instruments and measurement devices surround the jar on a clean white laboratory table. A researcher's hands wearing white latex gloves are visible adjusting dials on monitoring equipment. The bell jar has a slight green tint and shows authentic glass reflections. Sterile fluorescent lighting illuminates the scene. Generate in a 1:1 aspect ratio.
```

## üé≠ **HYBRID CREATIVE TECHNIQUES**

### **CCTV Footage - Artist's Studio**
```
Generate a photorealistic image that looks like CCTV footage from a security camera mounted in the corner of an artist's studio. The camera captures a figure in paint-covered overalls working frantically on a massive canvas, paint splatters flying everywhere. Canvases are scattered around the room, some finished, others half-complete. Paint buckets are knocked over with colorful puddles spreading across the concrete floor. Add timestamp and date in the top left corner and "CAMERA 3" in the top right corner. Generate in a 3:2 aspect ratio.
```

### **Amateur iPhone Photo - Street Art Discovery**
```
An extremely casual iPhone photo taken hastily while walking. The image shows someone discovering an incredible piece of street art - a photorealistic mural of a portal opening into another dimension. The photo is slightly blurry from movement, with an awkward angle showing part of the photographer's foot in the corner. The lighting is uneven with some overexposure from streetlights. Other pedestrians in the background are motion-blurred. The composition is careless and spontaneous, like a surprised snapshot. Generate in a 2:3 aspect ratio.
```

### **Vintage Sepia - Future City**
```
Generate a vintage sepia photograph with torn and weathered edges. The image depicts a retrofuturistic city from the 1920s imagination - art deco skyscrapers with landing platforms for dirigibles, people in period clothing using jetpacks, and vintage cars that hover slightly off the ground. The photo should look aged with authentic wear marks, slight creases, and the soft focus quality of early 20th century photography. Generate in a 3:2 aspect ratio.
