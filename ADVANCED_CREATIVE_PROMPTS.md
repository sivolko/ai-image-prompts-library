## üîÑ **HYBRID TECHNIQUE COMBINATIONS**

### **POV + Bioluminescent**
```
A photorealistic POV image of a person's hands reaching toward massive bioluminescent mushrooms in a dark cave. The hands are wearing weathered hiking gloves, and the mushrooms emit soft blue and green light that illuminates the cave walls. Glowing spores float around the hands, and bioluminescent lichen creates patterns on the rocky surfaces. The person's headlamp is turned off, relying entirely on the organic light sources. The perspective shows the hands in the foreground with the glowing fungi filling the frame. Generate in a 3:2 aspect ratio.
```

### **CCTV + Weather Indoors**
```
Generate a photorealistic image that looks like CCTV footage from a security camera mounted in the corner of a living room. The camera captures an indoor tornado forming in the center of the room, with furniture and objects swirling in the air. A person sits calmly on the couch watching TV, seemingly unaware of the weather phenomenon. Add timestamp and date in the top left corner and "CAMERA 2" in the top right corner. The footage has the characteristic grainy quality of security cameras. Generate in a 3:2 aspect ratio.
```

### **Amateur Photography + Crystalline**
```
An extremely casual iPhone photo taken while walking that accidentally discovers an incredible crystal formation growing out of a city alley wall. The photo is slightly blurry from movement, with an awkward angle showing part of the photographer's shoe in the corner. The massive crystal structure is completely unexpected in the urban setting, growing between brick buildings. The lighting is uneven with some overexposure from streetlights hitting the crystal surfaces creating brilliant reflections. The composition is careless but captures something magical. Generate in a 2:3 aspect ratio.
```

### **Flash Photography + Temporal Layering**
```
Generate a grungy-style photo taken with a harsh camera flash that captures a house party where guests from different decades are partying together. 1920s flappers dance with 1980s punks while 1950s greasers play beer pong with modern college students. Everyone is dressed in their era's clothing but using contemporary party games and modern red cups. The flash illuminates all the anachronistic details - vintage hairstyles, period clothing, and mixed decorations from different decades. Generate in a 2:3 aspect ratio.
```

### **Vintage Sepia + Underwater Impossible**
```
Generate a vintage sepia photograph with torn and weathered edges depicting an impossible underwater Victorian tea party from the 1800s. Ladies in period dress with bustles and corsets sit around a floating table taking tea, with fish swimming between the teacups and seaweed growing on their elaborate hats. The photo has the soft focus and aged quality of early photography, with water distortion effects and air bubbles rising through the sepia tones. Minor creases and folds add to the antique authenticity. Generate in a 1:1 aspect ratio.
